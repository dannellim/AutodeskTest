# Personal Comments

### Environment
- Windows 11
- Java 16
- Eclipse IDE 2021-06
- Gradle 7

### Implementations
- Did test driven development by writing test cases first based on the examples provided.
- Added Rules and ErrorMsg classes to hold and organise string constants for easy maintenance and change in the future. (Perhaps translations like Android strings)
- Organised utility functions by generic and crytographic methods.

# Your Task
Our company has released a beta version of **String Reply Service** and it has been a huge success.
In the current implementation, the **String Reply Service** takes in an input string (in the format of `[a-z0-9]*`)
and returns the input in a JSON object.

For example,

```
GET /reply/kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "kbzw9ru"
}
```

As the service is widely adopted, there have been increasing feature requests.
Our project manager has come back with the following requirement:

The input string will now be comprised of two components, a rule and a string, separated by a dash (-).
Rules always contain two numbers. Each number represents a string operation.

The supported numbers are:

- `1`: reverse the string

   E.g. `kbzw9ru` becomes `ur9wzbk`

- `2`: encode the string via MD5 hash algorithm

   E.g. `kbzw9ru` becomes `0fafeaae780954464c1b29f765861fad`

The numbers are applied in sequence, i.e. the output of the first rule will
serve as the input of the second rule. The numbers can also be repeated,
i.e. a rule of 11 would mean reversing the string twice, resulting in no change to the string.

Giving a few examples,

```
GET /v2/reply/11-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "kbzw9ru"
}
```
```
GET /v2/reply/12-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "5a8973b3b1fafaeaadf10e195c6e1dd4"
}
```
```
GET /v2/reply/22-kbzw9ru
{
    "data": "e8501e64cf0a9fa45e3c25aa9e77ffd5"
}
```

## What you need to do
Use the boilerplate given and implement the above requirement.
Your implementation should consider future requirements, i.e. be able to easily add new rules.

Upon completing the task, please feel free to (though not required):

- host your code on Github
- include any readme to explain your setup/environment
- add/implement anything you think would be beneficial

## Build project

To build the project, simply run
```
./gradlew build
```

## Start project

To start the project, simply run
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Once the service started, the endpoint will be available at `localhost:8080`, so you can make request to the service endpoint

```json
GET localhost:8080/reply/helloworld

{
    message: "helloword"
}
```
